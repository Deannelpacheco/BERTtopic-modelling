packer find a barren planet we can dump her on and you you can just stay here and think about your attitude exit game update patch the update patch its there there so what its a wormhole uhuh that is the christmas update patch preinstalling itself the wormhole its just how the games expressing the uplink so so dalys custom build is still connected to the internet in some way if this is another one of your plans just stop before somebody else gets monsterfied no no this this can work we cant get online access from the ship hell have crippled permission yes but what if we fly into the wormhole like on purpose wed hit the system firewall exactly and have our rogue coding deleted yeah deleted as in as in die whether its dying would depend largely on your philosophical position regarding sentient code but we would cease to exist thats true but wed be free wed be free but this is academic since we have no means of getting to the wormhole theres no way to pilot the damn thing without daly here hed stop us like that what about if hes logged in but on pause like when his pizza came he was just frozen there flying would be possible but that wormholes a whole parsec away wed never reach it before he got back unless we stalled him for longer and that we do how if we can get dalys omni coder we can make a phone call right theoretically yes but if we can get real me on the phone again i um i may have some leverage leverage mmhm on yourself like what my uh photocloud account i know the password obviously theres some pretty interesting images on there that i should have deleted a while ago but i didnt so we can blackmail me im pretty sure that id do anything to keep those photos from getting out must be pretty pictures look if this is going to work we all have to be in on it ok flying into certain death in a wormhole beats another years with captain ass im in ok me too also me well i am out daly won dalys always won we just have to get on with it cos we dont have a chance yes we do we fly into the wormhole and we are extinct we are gone we are rid of his shit sounds peachy what is with you dont you wanna fight back why wont you fight back tommy who is tommy hes my son hes six years old at least he was when i woke up in here see in the early days of this ship it was just me and daly i was his pet project he tried everything to break me and i withstood it all cos just thought there was still a chance i could get out and see my boy again in a way i was right i did get to see him again just not the real him daly told me what happened back on the outside the real me uh brought tommy to work one day show him around he wouldve loved seeing all those computers hes really into that stuff anyway evidently tommy had a lollipop that day thats all daly needed he copied him in here it was tommy alright as alike in every way dad you know what he did to him tommy he took tommy and he threw him out of the airlock tommy daddy right out into space daddy he made me watch tommy have you ever seen an unsuited body compress in space they freeze and crack like a porcelain doll i take my hat off to daly the detail in this place is exceptional and he said hed do it again and again cos dalys still got tommys dna hes got all of our dna he keeps it in his bedroom in a fucking minifridge by his desk and so i have to stay in line because even if we die in here he can bring us back he can bring tommy back whenever he wants and god knows how hed take it out on him god knows what hed do so you see what choice do i have walton we are going to get that fucking lollipop but you gotta believe me can you do that can you good to see you at your position cole captain youve come at just the right time i have im picking up a distress signal from the surface of skillane iv

ballad plays oh wont you help pick up the pieces of a broken heart now im not certain but my understanding is that they would shove these into their intake orifices to generate power why would you

batteries dummy thats my point what more do you need right so let me get this straight they would shove these into their intake orifice and then what somebody help me out here robot their intake orifices had rocky pegs that would crush them into paste and then the paste would be forced into an internal vat of acid well of course that makes perfect sense they could have just dumped this thing into an exterior vat of acid to begin with and then they wouldnt need the rocky pegs i mean duh expecting logic from beings who have internal vats of acid is a little much its crazy who even designed them its unclear we checked their code no creator signature thats because they were made by an unfathomable deity that created them for no apparent reason out of dust just kidding they came from a very warm soup sorry for the wait champ and then somebody new set the whats the point of this thing apparently theres no point they just had them well thats underselling their influence they had an entire network that was devoted to dissemination of pictures of these things cat growls robot oh look its doing something its coming this way\",\"so if youre having doubts just hang on in there

so they left behind any humans with the practical skills to run the place instead they trusted everything to automated assistants hello i am elena your electronic seastead attendant hello elena i am a human seasteader could you haul in the fishing net so i can eat i could but i wont catch your own fish you disgusting meatbag oh my god this is where the robot uprising began the very cradle of our mighty civilization its its magnificent so if these tech millionaires had been just a little more socially inclusive they might have survived no they didnt have a chance they were mean to robots and then robots killed them so long elena and thanks for all the fish\",\"your race will soon be gone if if you intend to destroy us we will most likely youll destroy yourselves in intelligence is not a winning survival trait consider the scavenger feeding on your vomit two million years ago its ancestors made the galaxy tremble when they attacked the swarm we bred smarter tougher versions of their own race to fight them our nests were the only world theyd known and they fought with a fury and inventiveness we never could have matched it is an excellent strategy and the two of you make a perfect breeding pair i would never betray my race i will kill myself in which case i would simply clone you and raise the children myself bothersome and so i offer you a choice remain an intelligent living being or real ugly events so do you accept my offer doctor i accept your challenge we wont become parasites humans are different of course you are im glad i wont have to absorb you i would have missed your conversation\",\"we shall miss your conversation on the rest of our voyage dr afriel humanity is the kind of race\",\"submerged in the warm ebb and flow of life what is it foodgiver no good not feed take me to her come on then you mindless motherfuckers galina i have no name but you may address me as swarm i am one of its castes my specialty is intelligence we we mean you no harm we seek only knowledge and you sought to breed us use us but your crude experiments triggered certain genetic protocols and i was born i am only a few weeks old but i have millions of years of racial memory you are clearly an intelligent being surely we can find a way to please doctor im just a tool one the swarm has used to deal with threats like yours many times through her memories i understand your race an especially vigorous one i expect they could be here competing with us within a few hundred years hmm it will be sooner perhaps but on the timescale the swarm operates\",\"choke on it skin bucket records show that when the worlds economies began collapsing humanitys leaders retreated to these fortresses to wait out the chaos deep beneath the earth and then emerge to form a new world order dammit they built an impregnable nuclear fortress but didnt think to install a light switch hold on a sec i got it behold the final stronghold of the superpowers its a buffet so their plan was to seal themselves in a mountain and have dinner parties i told you snackish this report states that their selfsustaining hydroponic systems began failing when a fungus wiped out their first crop starvation set in and the survivors switched to something they called extreme democracy one man one vote the winner of this evenings election was the secretary of agriculture shut up no really he was

blood pit these dudes they made it through a minefield a bunch of barbed wire cousins with guns only to become survivalist cult kebabs at least they died free of governmental constraint on a spike on two spikes in that guys case so the whole of humanity tried to make it through the end of civilization with guns and spikes no of course not just the poor ones these humans had few economic or social advantages and fewer options the wealthy and powerful however had a variety of sophisticated survival strategies welcome to the unsinkable libertarian dream that is seasteading uh this is just an old oil rig yes okay technically true but also it is a fully sovereign nationstate on the high seas i think you got salt in your cpu he is not wrong during the collapse some wealthy humans attempted to create a new civilization in places like this well deer cant swim across the ocean can they so what did they expect to eat fish and sea greens but by then the seas had been overfished\",\"oh jeez you landed us in a minefield oh barely besides look at these mines theyre ancient they probably wont even go off anymore im sure that was the last of em come on weve got science to do yes an indepth survey of postapocalyptic humanity could uncover important insights for our nascent machine culture on how to survive right or blow our shiny butts into scrap metal ugh why did they call em survivalist camps if theyre just full of dead people seems like false advertising to me i know right and according to my thorough historical research whykeypedia these guys were actually looking forward to the collapse of civilization humans thought that with freedom from governmentsponsored medical attention and enough bullets and venison jerky they could found a utopian society well i can definitely see all the bullets but wheres the venison humans hunted deer to extinction along with every other animal larger than a cat yeah humans were snackish oh then they began raiding each others encampments theyre not aiming out the windows because the deer were coming for revenge you guys you guys you guys you guys i found a blood pit its not a blood pit its just a primitive booby trap well

promise that it would respect the human and constitutional rights of those who lived within its borders electronic humming there it kept evolving and soon it handed over a complex formula to eradicate the national debt within one year yogurt follow it exactly any deviation will bring complete economic ruin we will narrator naturally the politicians didnt follow instruction\",\"no one argues with the yogurt no one tweaks its formulas thats how it happened but we still ask ourselves if the yogurt was smart enough to solve our debt problem wasnt it also smart enough to realize that human intellectual vanity would keep us from following the formula exactly then theres this in the past several weeks the yogurt rocket engines blasting has initiated several space launches life from earth

and i you its good to see another human face and please call me galina what dont be alarmed it will convey your pheromones to the queen otherwise you might be considered an invader and killed i followed your study of the swarm with tremendous interest doctor but i had no idea youd learned to communicate with them not exactly i found no swarm castes that use language but several symbiote species still do i call these springtails i believe they were once a spacefaring race who discovered the swarm and were absorbed by it but now they are little more than parasitic savages so far ive identified unique symbiotic aliens living among the hundreds of specialized castes native to the swarm\",\"forcing the animal kingdom to adapt et cetera et cetera a certain level of tool use is

its half hate they dont mean it the hate in a marriage thats in d thats had work put into it thats sincere yeah im divorced um the husbands up and talking youre gonna love his alibi shes here i heard jo screaming from upstairs and when i ran in she was walking round the room stumbling she was clutching she was clutching her head as if she was in pain and then for a moment she stopped and then it was like a seizure she was thrashing and clawing at her own skin and she turned she smashed her head onto the desk hard then she she pushed me over that mustve been when the bottle smashed and then she she picked it up and she started cutting herself here she was gouging i tried to stop her but she did this then she cut her throat i tried to stop her she cut her own throat with the glass mutilated and then killed herself for no apparent reason id say the odds are against that he said it was like she was having a seizure i mean maybe there was something in the cake the cake it had fucking bitch iced on it couldve been something in it like a drug i dont know that makes people kill themselves he was sort of convincing he just doesnt seem the dont say the type hes ordinary that is

jurisdiction to another its you know like a its like a like a phone between cell masts exactly it tried to do that but there was nothing to switch to unless someone spoofed a hive and then theyve used that to commandeer your adi no you would need a diagnostic controller to do that whats the range on one of those metres perhaps so whoever was controlling it would have to be no more than metres away outside the house yeah or sitting in a car even can you trace back who did this yes iim already trying to do that you know what erm it would be easier without an audience ok you two swap numbers keep a line of communication can you shut the whole thing down if need be hypothetically speaking even a short stoppage would damage the ecosystem and wed need approval from the department of the environment well need a list of any granular staff that had access to that system past or present some of those were government employees use a different font for those if it helps bye nick thats a set of granular personnel records root out anyone interesting maybe not just one could be a group involved yeah listen technically we should refer this up to the nca but theres no fucking way theyre taking this off me the nca already knows about it what dci karin parke yes shaun li national crime agency how come youre here theres been more than one this is tusk last night shit they thought it was a fit took him to the hospital he had to be anaesthetised to stop him mutilating himself xray seemed to indicate some kind of plaque or tumour in his brain so they popped him in the mri yeah basically one big magnet tore it right out of his head through the eye socket battered the adi too yours is more intact so im gonna need it for analysis its evidence twos a pattern knocks any malfunction theory in the head and theyre similar victims similar both in the middle of online shit storms well if you wanna kill someone theres a million easier ways to do it pull this off and youve done it from across the street no fingerprints no dna its like wishing them dead fuck fuck guys come here ok so erm jo powers and tusk both were being kicked around the internet for hours but in both their cases people were also tweeting their photos deathto like our friend the teacher right she didnt know where shed first heard of it but trace it back and it looks like the first real use of the hashtag was last weekend by who er looks like erm looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts erm automated its like spam this is someone trying to seed the tag you know get it out there its like bait this is someone wanting people to pick up on it check out the senders avatar photos bees shit ok theres more so each tweet had a sort of instruction video attached to it there game of consequences its like an unpopularity contest pick someone you dont like and if enough other people choose the same name then thats who gets targeted here watch game of consequences pick a target my god post their name and photo with deathto no most popular target will be eliminated after pm each day game resets at midnight no no fuck someones holding a public ballot bumping off the top person jesus its just mad yeah and its growing day one people used the hashtag on jo powers ok on day two used it on tusk whos using it now theres i mean theres loads more people theres quite a few votes for the chancellor yeah erm but at number one is people using it on someone called clara meades whos she clara meades ok erm it looks like she was at a demo and she took a selfie in front of a war memorial pretending to piss on it nice work clara yeah its getting near the end of the vote and her mentions are blowing up tusk isnt public knowledge yet um no so people cant know the hashtag works theyre using it to scare her yeah but theyre gonna get her killed and we need to get to her before five yeah pulling her citizens details youre not supposed to have access to that yeah i know just getting her location there fuck hello yeah she is but alright alright hold on clara police for you how did they get my number hello clara meades this is dci karin parke met police sorry to track you

be like like deleting an email no no no deletion im not doing it she wants to be near parker i cant take that away from her theres got to be something you can do my friends youre in luck its something were beta testing its actually aimed at terminally ill parents kind of like a souvenir for their kids here a monkey more like a keepsake we can put her in here in there uhhuh its it has a consciousness receptor kind of like the one we put in your head but a prototype and theres a camera here so she can see parker plus the whole bodys got haptic feedback so if little parker gives it a cuddle shell feel it and she can communicate back but in a kidfriendly controlled way yeah i dont know im going to have to think about it i say yes well shes done her thinking how about you the transfer went pretty fast carrie wouldnt have even been aware it was happening until she woke up come on buddy you gotta tear it tear into that thing jack you almost got it there you go alright pull

made it illegal to transfer human consciousnesses into limited formats like this got to be able to express at least five emotions for it to be humane apparently human rights for cookies right carrie

pair of you arent very popular but ill tell you what you are though youre famous the trial of victoria skillane finally concluded today the verdict guilty together with her fiance lain rannoch whose death in custody had delayed the trial skillane abducted sixyearold jemima sykes just miles from her home prompting a nationwide search amidst emotional pleas from her parents for months the youngsters disappearance had been a mystery the sole clue being her distinctive white teddy bear discovered in a layby two miles from the family home the white bear became an enduring symbol in the hunt for jemima a hunt that ended in a local forest jemimas body was found here it had been wrapped in a sleeping bag and burnt the couple were caught after harrowing footage of jemimas torture and murder was discovered on a mobile phone in skillanes possession lain rannoch identified by his distinctive tattoo killed the youngster as victoria skillane held the camera breaking down in tears skillane admitted to filming jemimas final moments claiming her fiance had pressured her into helping him maintaining she was under his spell the jury was not convinced by skillanes story and neither was the judge who labelled her a uniquely wicked and poisonous individual you were an enthusiastic spectator to jemimas suffering you actively revelled in her anguish he said adding her punishment would be proportionate and considered by hanging himself in his cell many believe lain rannoch evaded justice the public mood is now focussed on ensuring his accomplice\",\"kenny big spillage on table

you to where you were mm thats familiar ok now hold that smell in your mind close your eyes and picture the street getting something now yeah i went to a sort of comic shop culty stuff um i think it

man that man saved lives no doubt about it good luck huh bye stay in touch bye bye bye that was nice and incidentally if youll allow me to be crude dawsons symphatic diagnoser came in handy in the bedroom his implant received pleasurable sensations too so if his girlfriend slipped on that transmitting blue hairnet and he tuned in his little implant nubbin oh my god you feel he didnt just feel what he was feeling im going to come but also felt what she was feeling son of a bitch was experiencing male and female orgasms at the same time oh my oh my oh my god oh my god shit i cant get enough of your but im sorry dawsons having a great time theres got to be a but oh hes having a great time but but coming through coming through come on almost there one day they rush in senator whitley hed collapsed at some fundraiser no one could tell what in hell was wrong with him three two one lift ive got this dawsons hooked up be careful ok oh oh jesus and has the roughest ride oh pete like hes got no clue what this is pete just one more minute please let the man work oh its a pain hes never known oh oh shit hes flatlining just one more moment then it happened pete dawson blacked out for like five minutes turns out the senator had been poisoned a rare poison at that some kind of russian shit hed been into that whole thing but dawson had experienced death and come out the other side at the moment of death a whole galaxy of synapses fritzes out of existence tsunami of endorphins and then theres this rolling dark wave of nothing rushes in behind when he came round they ran every kind of test but he was all systems go nothing wrong shaken but unharmed they put on his report next day he was back up and at em but there was something wrong right to go through all that without dying fucked up his implant like that oh my god im just going to get some water ok ah oh goddammit fair to say his relationship with pain had shifted a little uh that hurt like hell now he was into it he really threw himself into his work after that he tried to hide it at first but thanks to that little nubbin the more pain he felt the more pleasure he got ok no stop stop ok safe word stop you said that we could try it and we did look we tried the hair pulling and that choke thing im not into it ok its just not me maybe i should go no no please im sorry stay please ow pete im going see its like eating chillies you acclimatise fast first time you had a jalapeno bet you spat it out too hot but persevere and it becomes addictive soon a jalapenos not enough you work your way up redhot chillies birdseye chillies till you get to them scotch bonnet devils dawsons craving was just the same before you know it hes hanging around the er just waiting for a juicy accident victim to latch onto all he can think about is that next hit gnawing away up there give it back to me give it back got to have it back sarah will you just file these for me sure thing pete this isnt your shift i just pete careful and three two one lift let me get this as soon as he jacks in he feels it its a cardiac arrest she collapsed in the street i just want to be sure its a heart attack alright but he says nothing plays for time figures he can ride that pain train all the way through to nirvana eventually they have to physically pull dawson away from her give aunt ethel her cpr she flatlines in front of him and hes like an alcoholic watching someone pour a glass of good scotch down the sink sick at the waste of good shit look we always knew going into this there might be side effects i mean we can look into how we deactivate but its going to take some time i cant just pull all the people off the other projects pete i mean we have milestones to hit you know the drill but well get there in the meantime we cant have you near patients so just go home put your feet up and binge a miniseries whatever no one couldve known what would happen next authorities are expected to confirm the body is that of missing wnl weather reporter denise stockley certainly a major police presence there as we can see lets take a look at the timeline dawson was home alone climbing the walls withdrawal i guess she was last seen the evening of friday september th he didnt have patients to leech pain off any more so he started inflicting it on himself for her safe return or for any information from witnesses spent a week just whittling away at himself cut here a gouge there i mean the guy was a doctor he knew how far he could go without it getting fatal but it was never enough none of it was enough when he worked on himself there was a crucial ingredient missing fear the amygdala little almondshaped nubbin in your brain when youre afraid it lights up like a midnight airstrike sharpens the senses the fear the patient feels when theyre staring up at that ceiling light the fear accompanying each sudden jab of agony hed come to appreciate that too it went with the pain complimented it like red wine and steak you can inflict pain on yourself but not terror for that you need a volunteer dawson was practically coming when they found him hed enjoyed one big old speed ball of fear and pain and death tell me they put him in jail in the hospital he wound up in a vegetative state good still there to this day in a coma deep as the ocean but the thing of it is they say he still has that look on his face blissed out still riding that high youre fucking with me right ok i added the boner i couldnt resist fun story huh yes fun story wooh oh man do you want some water really im fine no man its no bother thank you kindly so how come you didnt stay in med tech well i did for a while just cos dawson went lala neuro research didnt stop tckr adapted it and finetuned it its how they wound up with a digital consciousness transference what they call cookies today uh like when they upload old people to the cloud yeah this is way before that we didnt have that whole immersive vr environment shizzle back then what we dealt with was more organic almost iofi how so got to say you ask more questions than the average bear well to be honest my cars still charging so ive got a bit of time well then what i wanted to show you um part of what i was working on its um cute actually one of the saddest things in the whole place doesnt look it you ever had one of those relationships where you just cant get someone out of your head\",\"cooeee hes actually looking at you look out maybe youre his type he looks so real well it is him or a fully conscious upload of him youre probably wondering how he got in here after tckr kicked me out my plan was to branch out into celebrity consciousness sign up famous people and reincarnate them as holograms after they die kind of like a living madame tussauds but celebrities thats just a quagmire too many rights issues arsehole representatives but convicted killers its a different story michael was asking about you yesterday take it to jesus i know its hard mr lee allow me to introduce myself my name is rolo haynes they say youre in technology uh yes that is true so you can look into this dna thing prove it wasnt me um yes thats certainly a possibility but thats not why im here i have a proposal goodbye no wait i have a proposal i can help i can help your family howd you talk him into it he didnt need much convincing so really its just signing over the rights to your digital self in case the worst happens and i promise your relatives will receive the lions share of any profits so if you know god forbid you do get sent to the chair you know your family will be provided for for life how did his family feel about it they didnt give a shit abandoned him the moment he got locked up i know right jesus christ clay its your soul aint no such thing its just a computer simulation or something then why does he need your permission if my pardon comes through it wont matter and if it doesnt then if they send me to the chair this is going to pay its going to keep you and the kids above water maintain a roof over you all baby dont this could be a good thing but he never did get that pardon shit no cos he was guilty but wasnt there some doubt you know that documentary fake news hatchet job what about the dna tampering seriously theres no doubt about it the day he got the chair was a great day for justice clayton couldnt complain i mean he was going to be a pioneer i was going to slurp up his entire consciousness hed be the first guy on death row to survive his own execution the transfer went beautifully before i knew it clayton was born again hi buddy congratulations to you youre in the afterlife so to speak looking good am i a ghost if that helps yeah ive just got to test a few things here ok so this may seem a little weird just hang on in there what the fuck see i knew just seeing the guy walking around captive that was good but that wasnt much of a draw but pulling the lever yourself now thats an attraction hey ok hey three two one dawsons pain tech had paved the way for it a perfect recreation of exactly how the agony of electrocution feels every volt simulated for real the key was never let him exceed seconds at max voltage that would wipe his digital synapses out for good kill him ten seconds seemed to be the optimum shock length so that became the attractable limit ok have a little rest get used to your room official openings tomorrow in fact in the early days the problem was fitting everyone in please dont do it please please please please please please dont do it but of course it was really the souvenirs that were driving trade it was beautiful every time you finished juicing him out pops a conscious sentient snapshot of clayton not a recording a true copy of his mind perpetually experiencing that beautiful pain stuck forever in that one perfect moment of agony always on always suffering and what youd call fun size take a seat if it makes it easier sit down what my accent not fucking british sorry to disappoint who are you youre missing parts of the story out mr haynes why is that you forgot to mention the protests his wife started a campaign got some momentum behind it guess youd call it virtuesignalling bullshit but i know it hurt your attendance and even the protesters got bored after a while as soon as it was clear the state wouldnt do a damn thing about clearing him they just moved onto the next viral miscarriage of justice they can hang a hashtag off of but they did their job right this place was on the shit list who was your core clientele after that you lost the day trippers the tourists the fun family crowd who was left you again you pastyfaced motherfucker loners sadists the supremacist sicko demographic no no no no no no no out out out and that crowds not big enough they dont keep the lights on so if someone shows up some classic racehate rich guy with a hardon for power and he slips you something extra for a longer time at the crank you take it thank you wasnt the same after that was he not dead but hardly alive either even the perverts didnt want to pull a a lever on a vegetable wheres the joy in that but someone came to see him right she saw him she stood on this spot saw what you had done to him clay he was like a docile animal god knows if he even recognised her god knows if he even recognises me dad happy birthday what my mum saw that day was more than she could take she had hoped during the whole fight to clear his name but that just broke her you know what she did when she came home bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka i found her you fucking piece of shit whoa is it hot its humid right im sorry stupid digital ac easy to hack never accept drinks from strangers my daddy taught me that going by the colour of your lips youre going to be gone in seconds hey dont worry were going to see you on the other side hey computer says youre awake congratulations youre a pioneer what the fuck did you do turns out that it is possible to transfer a fresh consciousness inside a virtual one my daddys giving you a ride get me out of here you fucking cu im guessing youre screaming and calling me names right now but i wouldnt know you i mean my dad cant talk thanks to you otherwise im guessing hed pass on your goodwill messages you fu you fucking bitch you fucking bitch in other news youll shortly be undertaking

bundy or a fred west so exhales if we take this anywhere the first question any platform network whatever is gonna ask is whats the hook whats the context there is a personal angle i mean his dad was one of the victims uh yeah he he was a policeman he was shot at the farm so he was murdered he died later of his injuries or not directly but but but basically yeah pia but he was one of the victims davis mm this gives him a voice and you know thats important to me you know as a as a son woman i think definitely explore the personal angle see what there is in it but um can you get hold of any new material police interviews diaries that kind of thing we can look into those something unseen unheard unexplored is what you need what about the house itself and the dungeon its still there and you have access yes absolutely so how come youre using this old thing uh the police forensics shot on tape back then pia plus old tech cool analog horror atmosphere stuart proper blair witch davis pia

report six months ago millions were stunned to learn that grammywinning pop sensation ashley o had suffered a catastrophic allergic reaction while dining at home she slipped into a coma where she remains to this day now with days to go until the singers th birthday i was given a behindthescenes look at how shes doing its a day ashley os aunt and manager catherine ortiz will never forget a day her niece almost died it was just a few bites from a shrimp taco we didnt even know she had a shellfish allergy i really thought we were going to lose her i just thank god dr munk was in the house at the time but despite munks heroic efforts ashleys coma proved irreversible but incredibly ashleys music career didnt end there thanks to a remarkable technological leap we discovered that although we couldnt communicate with ashley we could read her brainwaves using a temporal interceptor once plugged in what they heard stopped them in their tracks music she was still composing music in her head in her dreams by linking ashleys mind to a computer technical director jackson habanera began the miraculous process of extracting new material thats a gsharp thats an a another gsharp it was beautiful it was beautiful and i just knew there had to be someway to get this out to her fans thats what she would want there was only one problem ashley might be dreaming new music but she wasnt capable of recording it until technology stepped in once again we had hours of recordings of her voice every vowel every syllable we used for the voice of the ashley too dolls those dolls were withdrawn from sale apparently over battery issues but the ashley too vocal mimicry software proved invaluable and became the allnew voice of ashley o like i can oh so thats a computer singing mmhmm just like the real thing sorry its so beautiful one things for sure with her aunt watching over her the ashley o story is far from over hey there im ashley too whats your happy birth you can do ashley

anything but he did say he needs to speak to billy bauer on the phone billy bauer as in billy bauer hello im here this is penelope wu from smithereen i understand youve asked to speak with mr bauer thats right so have you got billy bauer on the line hello sorry uh yes were doing everything we can may i speak to jaden hes fine i just need to check hes okay tell them youre okay uh im okay there so youd better hurry up and get billy bauer on the phone its still very early where he is were having difficulty reaching him thats not my problem well meantime could you maybe outline what this is regarding no im only speaking to him sure its just im actually the coo okay and well it might be quicker if i can present him with a just fucking get billy bauer on the phone right now im not fucking around here i will blow his fucking head off do you understand im sorry of course i apologize im gonna put you back on hold i promise you we are working on it dont be long well hes not stable oh in what way don jesus christ i dont think that music helped him any but i switched the line so now while hes hearing that we can listen in to see whats happening at his end fucking messing me around this is my last day this is my last day this is my last day this is my last day this is my last day this is my last day this is my last day this is my last day this is my last day this is my last day this is my last day whats he saying this is my last day this is my last day gets dark again the whole thing falls apart i guess it doesnt really matter bout the rain cause well get through it anyway well get up and eleanor mrs gillhaney police hello hello eleanor eleanor are you okay mrs gillhaney mrs gillhaney i dont think anyones home got a weird one here naj fucking hell thats him all right this is mad look oh great everything all right yeah were looking for an eleanor gillhaney bit late she uh died in march we could be lifted from the shadows lifted oh we could be okay guys stand by for instruction you and i forever baby thats her son chris christopher he moved in when she died well couple of months at any rate on his own yeah keeps to himself drives to work each morning think he works somewhere in london has something happened to him got a positive id on the suspect names christopher gillhaney okay he seems to be staying at his late mums place lots of red bills and its up for repossession what have you got on the suspect former teacher sorry hes a teacher well he was a teacher it hes been registered unemployed going on two years hows his record fully dbs checked hes squeaky clean only place he shows up is as a victim in a road traffic accident november drunk driver plowed right into him two dead including the drunk okay good work najma maam teacher with a real gun not impossible but not likely maam its the fbi what its the fbi urgent call chief superintendent grace hi chief superintendent this is ernesto cruz from the fbi right sorry whats this regarding were liaising with smithereen silicon valley theyre also on this call what theyre on the line as well yes hi this is penelope wu from smithereen with me is don from legal and shonelle from analytics uh david gilkes negotiator listen ms wu weve identified the suspect christopher michael gillhaney former schoolteacher thirtythree years old he has a smithereen profile right so first off christophers on hold but we are able to listen in to his end of the line so well share live feed of that with you guys yeah thats useful in addition we figure we could share the data we have on him to assist negotiations at your end but first perhaps you could share with us your perception of what hes doing probably extortion whether its targeted at your company is something we dont oh its targeted sorry were looking into who christopher is groupwise wed slot him into high intellect low income often angry people right well we checked to see if hed ever expressed hostile sentiments towards smithereen as an entity but nothing shows up on his social in fact theres been nothing there at all for some time his whole account is dormant i dont see how this is relevant but then we checked in with the hitcher guys right so the cab that picked jaden up is registered to an omar masimbalu and a name like that i think youll agree does not exactly match mr gillhaney no turns out it was a compromised account people trade them on the dark web seems likely chris got a hold of it that way you appreciate what im saying hes been covering his tracks uhhuh so we asked hitcher to share his account activity and it seems for weeks hed been only accepting jobs specifically outside the smithereen london address just parked up each day waiting until he got a job from someone inside the building this this is a whole plan hes had going on here i mean this is sophisticated criminal behavior i find it hard to believe hes never raised red flags before his records totally clean i mean he was the victim in the auto accident in he lost his fiance in that crash were you aware of that no but you are there were historical posts inside his network condolences memorials and thats when chris disengages in fact not interacting with friends even though hes expressing grief youve done your homework okay im thinking this isnt about money david go on chris is about the same age as bauer right theyve both got geeky backgrounds computers david maybe even chris thinks its about money but its actually about status bauers got money power respect whats christopher got hes skint hes driving a hookie cab hes just lost his fiance his mum as well what if christopher thinks he wants what bauers got but really its just about getting his attention what if thats whats going on is that gonna help you talk him out of that car if hell listen to me yeah christopher hello christopher christopher my name is david gilkes im david okay if you can see me im the berk waving his arm in the air okay the one in the cheap suit listen theres a whole load of police here and to be honest theyre just doing their jobs but i think theyre worried youre gonna hurt yourself or someone else i dont think you will christopher but im not sure that they think that you know how they get chris thats me calling you chris oh leave me alone i just wanna talk to you for a moment harris if we need you you got a clear shot no clear shot yet hostage is directly behind the gunman can you shut up please can you hand me that chris i know youre pretty stressed at the moment are you the negotiator my name is david thanks for that david are you the negotiator well some people call me that but really im just a ive read up about negotiators youll pretend to be my friend and then youll slowly try to convince me to give myself up chris youre obviously a smart guy so i wont bullsh and if gentle persuasion doesnt work youll keep me distracted on the phone long enough for one of your snipers to get a good head shot is that right david well look lets just try to no no lets just you fuck off get off the line im waiting for billy bauer okay youre the guy in the cheap suit yeah thats what you said yeah uhhuh okay so

this is actually real and will be available to stream from friday uncomfortable chuckle uh why awful why is it all so negative yeah no thats a great question fatima um we did try more affirmative content in the test cell but we found that um our subjects just didnt buy it it didnt chime with their neurotic view of themselves what we found instead was when we focused on their more weak or selfish or craven moments it confirmed their innermost fears and put them in a state of mesmerized horror which really drives engagement they literally cant look away lets kill this quamputa fatima

proprietor well just us two this morning you sure you want to do this this place aint for the fainthearted im sure i can handle it not everyone can so i have to peek into your little sack there if thats ok oh thats ok cant trust anyone these days if you could step through there anything metal put it in here cool dinky ah yeah i call it fun size fun size i like that guessing you had a gut full of this security shit at the airport our immigration guys are pretty tight these days all clear ok show on the road so are you on vacation sort of my dad lives out here uhhuh its his birthday so my mum just wants to surprise him and youre the surprise part of it i guess where did you fly in salt lake you came here from salt lake yeah i thought itd be nice to drive the back route but i underestimated the heck of a trip for a girl on her own i dont mean to get oldfashioned on you seriously that is quite oldfashioned its hot as hell in here the ac mustve shit the bed sorry for the heat god damn digital systems never trust a guy in tech jesus i should know that so what is all this stuff authentic criminological artefacts if it did something bad chances are its in here take a look around take your time see what pops out at you anything piques your interest i can tell you all about it theres a sad sick story behind most everything here just like our main attraction which is just through there but lets not get ahead of ourselves lots of folks just rush behind the curtain hardly even eyeball this stuff and then its a bunch of onestar ratings on trip fucker and before you know it yo look i am not in a rush so dont worry well then take your time i shall this stuff looks techy well neuro tech was my background sweet so whats this then looks like a hairdressing thing actually that was one of my very first souvenirs sheds a little light on how our main exhibit came to be what is it you heard of peter dawson uhuh doctor peter dawson well usually i say this is dawsons symphatic diagnoser and folks shriek no way and im like oh it very much is how the heck did you get that is the next question ok my domain was med tech i worked out of san junipers its kind of like a university hospital sweet setup part of the land act actually it was in downtown new york big old building research up top emergency room and the great unwashed down at street level it was the perfect mix of business and healthcare seriously out of the way arsehole idea was folks with no coverage signed up for free healthcare in exchange for consenting to occasional experimental treatments i i i worked for the guys up top what like a scientist i was more sort of recruitment ok clear yeah im here shocking no no no ok im going again clear clear got it shocking no if id known she was on tricyclics i wouldve nudged the dose you couldnt have known this a bad time rolo haynes from the tenth floor seems youve been having some problems i think ive got something that can help the big thing theyre into is neuro technics pioneering brain enhancements neural interfaces all that fun stuff the holy grail theyve been aiming for is a way to transfer knowledge so one of the teams here is working on an experiment trying to find a way to beam information from one brain to another this is kenny this is hector stay with me on this so the experiment they built a little maze and they drop kenny here into it he runs round over and over for months on end till he knows it like a childhood home and then they put this on him its a transmitter absorbing signals from kennys brain which were sent to hector over here hector had our prototype synaptic receiver fitted now remember hector had never even set paw in the maze plan was hed now receive kennys knowledge of the maze layout and boom hed be able to solve it first time did he no scrabbled around like a rat fucking imbecile so um why are you telling me this because just as it becomes clear that the maze things a bust one of our researchers spills his coffee on kenny hot coffee spills all over kenny so obviously hes squealing like hell but so is hector turns out we havent discovered how to share knowledge but physical sensations bingo thats nuts holy shit and even nutsier shit hector felt the burn but took no damage at all all of the experience none of the physical cost but how did he die they cut him open after to see if he was ok oh anyhow thanks to hectors sacrifice we prototyped this a receiver for human experiences a neural implant only one of its kind this is why you brought me up here whats the biggest pain in the arse with patients finding out whats wrong with them in the first place half of the arseholes that roll in here cant even describe their symptoms theyre theyre either out cold or concussed or drunk or dumb or years old or they cant speak english imagine if you could feel exactly what a patient feels minus the physical consequences like reading their minds so what do you say got to hand it to dawson he leapt at the chance like he was happy to do it and it was only a short procedure irreversible but hey he was a pioneer plus his mortality rates were in the toilet so this was his best shot at redemption does it hurt if i touch it i dont think so theres something kind of kinky about it its like the ultimate piercing if youre trying to make me feel better its working time for the trial run so this is where our hairnet doohickey comes into play theory was if you slipped it on a willing subject itd absorb their physical sensations and relay them to dawsons implant we just had to find out if it worked ow this one houston we got a miracle right off the bat dawson gets to work with the ailing public starts building up a kind of library of physical symptoms plan was hed get to know how things felt so that he could diagnose them quicker so start small in the er minor fractures that sort of thing soon graduates to bigger stuff major injuries diseases latestage terminal stuff dawson grit his teeth and went through it all say a kid comes in obviously in pain doctors suspect appendicitis theyd hook him up to dawson just to be sure dawson had felt appendicitis many times by now so he knows if its something more\",\"honour and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all others be faithful unto him to my best man anthony lets hear it for him youve been there from

redecorate hello hello no theyve got the whole thing were not in control anymore theyve got the whole thing what are you doing fix it cant you fix it shut up shit we need to go now now clara go go go go what is whats happening karin in there go help me block the gap tell me whats going on youre scaring the shit out of me fuck the fan the fan get it away from me take your time id seen so many bodies before at crime scenes in autopsies but id never seen anyone die and she was right there and can you describe the reaction of your colleague miss colson blue took it hard shaun ill shut it down before then we thought this was one guy some mr mystery in the vicinity hijacking one adi and personally controlling it but there were thousands of them so it cant be that right no one person cant fly hundreds at once no whoever this is theyre controlling the whole system do you know where theyre controlling it from no could be anywhere well you need to fucking sort this out how do the adis know who to target couldve found clara the same way you did the identity database no that just gives you the basic area we were in the room too and they only went for her facial recognition its got to be facial recognition which means the feed from their visual sensors thats been accessed too thats not possible its the only explanation now look the visual feed is secure between each adi and the hive there you go although one of the governments conditions for backing the project ok enough was that we we had to consent to permitting enough government security services access to the visual feed at times of quote increased national security which is as i understand it pretty much all the time i wasnt happy about it your lot went along with it well that implies a greater range of options than your lot presented so they are spying on us this is all classified so what did you do did you put in a backdoor and route it through gchq i mean you do cctv you do traffic cams so what dont you have your fucking noses in look millions of those things flying around propping up the ecosystem well thats just great save the planet hallelujah governments not going to pump billions into it just cause some lab coat says so it grabs green votes they saw an opportunity to get more they took it total nationwide surveillance weve tracked suspects for weeks in ways they couldnt dream of weve prevented bombings mass shootings by spying on the public and keeping them safe which is what they want clara meades isnt safe though is she shaun knowing what you knew that mightve helped us but no you kept your little fucking secret didnt you ok the governments a cunt we knew that already words going to get out about clara the publics going to wake up and find this mental assassination game going on and soon were going to have another body so what do we do i dont know were were totally locked out totally blind if i can work out how they got in i might be able to reverse engineer some means of getting control back do the adis have a command log onboard cache yeah but thats encrypted right well ill need the key to that been through the employee files found some pols bring them in are you sitting in on these granular interviews ive got to be somewhere its three deaths have now been linked to a hashtag circulating on social media controversial journalist jo powers good morning have you posted the hashtag is it real or an urban myth well thousands have been taking part but how culpable are they people are dying and we want to hear your thoughts line seven liana this is real this is happening am happy to see her die its not the hashtag whos the one killing them thats just a game like if youre an arsehole you deserve to be shamed steve line five yeah but my point is someones gotta be top of the list yeah so why not make it someone you know like who deserves it like a racist right now with the hashtag ive seen celebrities politicians everyone this doesnt mean you have to sit there encouraging people to take part the point is this is already happening and people know that they can jump onboard because nobody will ever know if they did or didnt well lets just pause for a moment and go back to that top five as we have been saying the chancellor is at number one and i want us to think about that what does that tell us about the choice of the nation well i cant say im surprised that hes number one on the list hes been pretty unpopular for quite a long time now but does that warrant his place on this list what im saying is people dont have to think too hard about it now thats hes number one that should generate more discussions and probably more votes thanks for your time no good no good well thats all fascinating shaun but when do we shut it down tom forgive me for being sceptical about your agencys basic competence tom im on the fucking chopping block here number one on the list the peoples fucking choice farringtons number four and hes a paedophile suspected paedophile he did it you know he did lets just shut it down all social media the whole bloody internet pull the plug just for today at least until thumbelina here pulls his finger out and he actually catches someone i wouldnt advise shutting things down but its possible we can do that the whole of social media yeah pull a north korea on it well yes technically right so push the off switch thats not a good idea no not in my opinion right ok its just that speaking as a marked man i beg to fucking differ if we shut it down youll still be number one guaranteed to be in fact hes right if we let it run on at least theres a few hours anything could happen before five oclock the vote might change yeah and it might not what about that report the archive job from that memo about farrington that was over an unrelated matter leak it tom that would be a smear a headtotoe shit smear i fucking hope so hes in his s hes had his life fuck him under the bus if i could suggest an alternative we move you to a safe location have you secured before five worked out well for you last night ill show you this next ones tess wallender she was a junior so not much in the way of technical skills quit granular for personal reasons nervous exhaustion yeah worked in human resources for granular until she quit she took a photo of a guy on the tube said hed harassed her lewd comments or something but

polling app now this can pinpoint you with gps so that when youre at a polling station it unlocks loads of free shit look thanks for voting dickhead thanks for voting dickhead its good isnt it whos this guy were meeting i dunno but hes from washington and hes got my restricted number jeff carter from the agency hey hey and ill leap right in i think what youre doing with waldo is fascinating from the agency yeah listen waldo may be the perfect political figurehead waldo the bear the bear people like the fact hes a bear is an assist an assist it helps right you look at human politicians youre instinctively like brrrr uncanny right like the girls in porn you know somethings wrong cos why else are they doing it its usually daddy issues eh just like politics waldo bypasses that you already know hes not real so no personal flaws im a person with respect waldos more than you hes a team and youre open about that which is fantastic the honesty thing works waldo is a construct people not just accept but embrace at the moment hes antipolitics which is a political stance itself right but he could deliver any brand of political content minus the potential downsides of a human messenger in a debate your team could google every word the other guy says then let waldo hit him with debunk stats and spit a twitterready zinger into the next sentence hes the perfect assassin we wont win though you guys are so british no of course he wont win you started out too coarse off the bat theres no substantial basis to what you offer and the whole nihilist democracy sucks thing yeah is kind of wackadoo but with a targeted hopeful message which we can provide energising the disenfranchised without spooking the middle via your new platform you got a global politicalentertainment product

commencing did he say what it is nope good morning morning shes in here so l go in and theres not just the wound from the glass theres a hole dug in a bore hole like a tiny tunnel so i follow it you know how deep does it go it goes all the way from her ear canal to deep in her brain where i find this nestled right in there looks quite cosy its one of those bee things an adi an autonomous drone insect from the granular project how did it get in there id say it burrowed in fuck me thats not the worst part it crawled right through her dorsal posterior insula which is basically the brains pain centre youre talking agony off the scale youd do anything to make it stop even cut your own throat good afternoon dci parke tdc blue colson ok thank you theyre so fucking fancylooking these companies billions on branding well they can afford it the whole adi projects pretty much bankrolled by the government its why so many people are paranoid about it let me guess this is some people on the internet they reckon the government uses the bees to spy on us theres a schizophrenic worldview jesus i didnt expect to find myself living in the future but here i fucking well am karin parke vanessa dahl please follow me youre after information on our project swarm adis thats right any particular reason yes rasmus rasmus sjoberg he heads swarm nice to meet you hi hi nice greenhouse yeah so your bees your adis talk me through them colony collapse disorder we still dont know whats behind it bees themselves were virtually extinct so what our adis do is effectively stand in for them theyre solar powered they dont need nectar but they pollinate flowers the same way they crawl inside pollen sticks to their legs and gets brushed off the next flower they visit can they make honey er no i was joking how do they know where the flowers even are i mean well they have a sensor like a camera no just a basic visual sensor you see they need rudimentary pattern recognition in order to locate compatible flora and navigate they navigate yes you dont i dont know steer them theyre autonomous thats right isnt it they make their own decisions they look after themselves yes you see the adis cover the whole of the uk we couldnt command each one individually ourselves its just not logistically possible no we simply set the behaviour and leave them to it they even construct these hives themselves they reproduce they reproduce yes each hive is a replication point its like a d printer basically exactly they create duplicates of themselves and create more hives and spread out exponentially cover the country maybe you should work here yeah well i read up on it its impressive it is its just a shame its necessary the alternative would have been environmental catastrophe bees were dying out so what is it that brings you here we think one of your adis may be involved in an unexplained death sorry a death thank you yeah its one of ours but look these are not designed to kill people id hope not could it have malfunctioned somehow no i mean when they do malfunction it happens but then they just break they just hit the ground what if someone hacked one and then they found a way of controlling it thats impossible you see its got militarygrade encryption and you would need a diagnostic controller which is also encrypted so i would say the likelihood is i dont know what hes saying but its not the same as impossible this is every hive we have online see these are the hives in the building here how many bees per hive around its like air traffic control yeah is that the search input yeah but youd need sorry jo powers postcode is that who this is about you said you get some malfunctions a fair few yes they smack into a car or something we even had people trap them you know put them in the microwave for a youtube video and this logs any that drop off the system logs everything yes\",\"stand aside its not fair its not fair next lot stand there would you like to be as
